Geant4 Simulation for Magnetic Field
This repository contains components for a Geant4-based simulation aimed at studying particle interactions in the presence of a magnetic field.

Files Overview
1. detector.hh
Purpose: Defines the SensitiveDetector class, which implements a sensitive detector in Geant4.

Details:

SensitiveDetector class inherits from G4VSensitiveDetector.
Reads efficiency data from eff.dat file for photon detection.
Implements ProcessHits method to record photon hits and detector positions.
2. action.hh
Purpose: Implements the ActionInitialization class for initializing user-defined actions in Geant4 simulation.

Details:

ActionInitialization class inherits from G4VUserActionInitialization.
Defines Build method to set up primary particle generation, run action, event action, and stepping action.
3. event.hh
Purpose: Defines the EventAction class to manage actions at the beginning and end of each event in the simulation.

Details:

EventAction class inherits from G4UserEventAction.
Implements BeginOfEventAction and EndOfEventAction methods to handle event initialization and finalize actions (e.g., energy deposition).
4. particlegenerator.hh
Purpose: Implements the ParticleGenerator class for defining primary particle generation.

Details:

ParticleGenerator class inherits from G4VUserPrimaryGeneratorAction.
Defines GeneratePrimaries method to specify primary particle properties (e.g., type, energy, direction).
5. run.hh
Purpose: Implements the RunAction class to manage actions at the beginning and end of each run in the simulation.

Details:

RunAction class inherits from G4UserRunAction.
Implements BeginOfRunAction and EndOfRunAction methods to initialize and finalize run-specific actions (e.g., creating output files, writing data).
6. stepping.hh
Purpose: Defines the SteppingAction class to manage actions at each step of particle propagation in the simulation.

Details:

SteppingAction class inherits from G4UserSteppingAction.
Implements UserSteppingAction method to track and accumulate energy deposition during particle propagation.
7. construction.hh
Purpose: Defines construction of detector geometry and materials for the simulation.

Details:

Provides construction methods for setting up detector geometry using G4Box, G4LogicalVolume, and related Geant4 classes.
Includes definitions for materials such as G4Material and physical volumes using G4PVPlacement.
Magnetic Field Implementation
To simulate a magnetic field using Geant4, ensure the following:

Define and initialize the magnetic field within the construction.hh file using G4UniformMagField or G4GlobalMagFieldMessenger.
Implement magnetic field-related actions in SensitiveDetector, EventAction, SteppingAction, or other relevant classes based on simulation requirements.
Usage
To use these components:

Ensure Geant4 libraries and headers are properly installed.
Include these header files in your Geant4 application.
Customize and extend these components based on your specific simulation requirements.
Build and Execution
Ensure to link with appropriate Geant4 libraries and compile your application with these components included.

To start the simulation:

1. First, download the files from GitHub using the git clone method.
2. Create a build folder within the directory where you downloaded your simulation files (use mkdir build).
3. Inside the build directory, run cmake ...
4. Then run make.
5. Execute the simulation with ./Mag_sim.
